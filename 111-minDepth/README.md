# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## Description
This project implements a function to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

## Project Structure

- **min_depth_binary_tree.py**: Contains the main implementation of the minimum depth calculation.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/min-depth-binary-tree.git
